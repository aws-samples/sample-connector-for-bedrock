# Sample Connector for Bedrock

This is a Bedrock (and other generative AI tools from AWS) API forwarding tool that can issue virtual keys, log chats, and manage costs.

It is compatible with any OPENAI client that can define Host and API Key.

## Main Features

### Supported Models and Platforms

- Supports all current and future large language models from Bedrock (supported through bedrock-converse).
- Supports models deployed through Sagemaker LMI (partial models).
- Supports other forms of custom models, including Ollama, etc.
- More AI workflow applications, such as internet search, AWS command executors, etc.

### API Key and Cost Management

- Create API keys. Keys can be created for regular users and administrators. Regular users can chat, while administrators can manage API keys and costs.
- Record the cost of each call and use it as a basis for cost control.
- Cost control. You can set monthly quotas and account balances for each API key. When the monthly quota or account balance is insufficient, it cannot be used.
- Calculate the overall cost.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>
> The cost calculation of this project cannot be used as the basis for AWS billing. Please refer to the AWS bill for actual expenses. [Please refer to the official website for the Bedrock pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing).

### Model Management

Models and their parameters can be defined from the backend.

Once defined, models can be bound to groups or API Keys.

## Changelogs

### 0.0.12

1. New provider: [urls-reader](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-connector-for-bedrock/providers/urls-reader/ ), which can parse URLs in user conversations and download the text content from the URLs to add to the conversation context.
2. Optimized the [painter](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-connector-for-bedrock/providers/painter/) provider, now supporting the Titan image model. The large language model has been changed to BRConnector's local model.
3. It is now possible to delete models, groups, and API Keys in the manager interface.
4. Bug fix: Automatic update script for CloudFormation EC2.
