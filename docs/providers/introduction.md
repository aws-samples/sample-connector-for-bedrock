# Using Provider

A Provider is used to provide services to the outside world through a Model.

First, you need to [create a new model](../user-manual/management.md#_3).

Select the corresponding Provider from the dropdown list.

Different Providers will correspond to different configurations.

This section will specifically describe the configuration for each model.
