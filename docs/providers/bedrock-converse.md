# bedrock-converse: LLM Consistent Interface

Sends messages to the specified Amazon Bedrock model. `Converse` provides a consistent interface that works with all models that support messages. This allows you to write code once and use it with different models. If a model has unique inference parameters, you can also pass those unique parameters to the model.
